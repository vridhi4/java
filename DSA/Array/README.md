An **array** is a collection of elements stored in a **contiguous memory location**, all of the **same data type**. It allows you to **store multiple values** under a **single variable name**, accessed using **index numbers** (starting from 0).

**Example in C**:

```c
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

* `numbers[0]` is 1
* Fixed size
* Efficient access using index
